# Backend Solution Overview

## Overview
Refactored backend using **modern ES Modules** for Node.js 18+, emphasizing **security**, **performance**, and **testability**.

---

## Key Improvements

### Security
- Removed unsafe dynamic code execution (`getCookie` with `Function.constructor`).  
- Centralized error handling using `notFound` and `errorHandler`.

### Async File Handling
- Replaced blocking `fs.readFileSync` with non-blocking `fs/promises`.  
- Server remains responsive even with large datasets.

### Optimized Stats
- `/api/stats` caches results in memory and recalculates only when the data file changes.  
- Significantly reduces CPU usage on frequent requests.

### Items API Enhancements
- Supports server-side search (`q` param) and pagination (`limit` param).  
- Returns proper `404` errors for missing items.  

### Centralized Config
- `config.js` stores paths and settings centrally.  
- Simplifies maintenance and testing.

### Testability
- `app` exported separately from `listen` for **unit tests** with Jest.  
- `mock-data` directory provides safe, repeatable test data.

### Performance & Maintainability
- Modular, clean code structure.  
- Easily extendable for frontend features like virtualization, live search, and scalable datasets.

## Summary
This refactoring ensures:
- **Secure backend** with no unsafe dynamic code.  
- **Non-blocking I/O** for responsive endpoints.  
- **Cached computations** for performance-critical stats.  
- **Fully testable routes** using Jest with mock data.  
- **Clean, maintainable architecture** ready for future enhancements.
